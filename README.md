# Data Explorer üöÄ

An intelligent platform for dynamic CSV visualization. Upload any CSV file and watch as Data Explorer automatically generates a beautiful, interactive dashboard with insightful charts.

## ‚ú® About The Project

Data Explorer was built to solve a simple problem: visualizing data from CSV files should be fast, intuitive, and beautiful. Instead of writing code or wrestling with complex BI tools for a quick analysis, you can simply drag and drop a file.

The backend intelligently analyzes the structure of your CSV, identifies numeric and date columns, and automatically generates a variety of relevant charts. The frontend provides a sleek, modern, and interactive interface to display these insights.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Application

You'll need to run the backend and frontend servers in separate terminal windows.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    * Open a terminal in the `backend` directory.
    * Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
    * Run the following command:
    ```sh
    uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```
    Your backend API will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    * Open a second terminal in the `frontend` directory.
    * Run the following command:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your frontend application will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to use the application!
